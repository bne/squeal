        Status
        ======
        
        This is a work in progress that is under active development. This package is
        currently of no use to you unless you are interested in contributing to
        development.
        
        Building the dependencies
        =========================
        
        In your checkout run ./depends.sh.  This works on jaunty and karmic, I have no
        idea about anything else.
        
        This will download everything you need and build it as appropriate.
        
        You'll get a few warnings, which I have ignored safely so far.
        
        Using the virtual environment
        =============================
        
        Then `source env.sh`
        
        Creating the base database
        ==========================
        
        ./create.py
        
        Adding a music directory (optional)
        ===================================
        
        ./addcoll.py /path/to/music/directory
        
        Starting it up
        ==============
        
        ./start-squeal
        
        Then point your browser to http://localhost:9000
        
        Setting up Spotify
        ==================
        
        You should now configure the spotify credentials through the web interface.  Hit the "Setup" button in the bottom right, and enter your spotify credentials in the web form.
        
        When you submit this form, it will connect to spotify.
        
        Connecting a SqueezeBox
        =======================
        
        Tell your player the IP address of your computer as the squeezecenter.  You
        will need to /etc/init.d/apparmor stop probably, since apparmor on jaunty is
        irksome.
        
        SoftSqueeze3
        ============
        
        This is the software player, which is awesome for testing.
        
        You'll need a jre::
        
        sudo aptitude install sun-java6-jre
        
        Make sure you're using the Sun JRE too, with::
        
        sudo update-alternatives --config java
        
        I had to do some messing about to get actual sound out of this, which I think
        is an ubuntu/jaunty/java issue.  I had to install::
        
        libcsnd-java
        
        To finally make it work - but before that I'd gone through these instructions:
        
        http://www.ubuntugeek.com/sound-solutions-for-ubuntu-904-jaunty-users.html
        
        Which may have been also required.  Who knows.
        
        Installing SoftSqueeze3
        -----------------------
        
        Download the rpm version without jre here:
        
        http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=105169&package_id=113211&release_id=671140
        
        Then convert it to a deb with::
        
        fakeroot alien softsqueeze_linux_3_8.rpm
        
        This will create a deb which you can install with::
        
        sudo dpkg -i softsqueeze_3.8-2_i386.deb
        
        This installs in (spit) /opt.  You can run it with::
        
        /opt/softsqueeze/softsqueeze
        
        It'll spin up, and on first run will ask for your server's IP address.  Just
        give it localhost.
