Building the dependencies
=========================

In your checkout run ./depends.sh.  This works on jaunty and karmic, I have no
idea about anything else.

You'll get a few warnings, which you can ignore.

Using the virtual environment
=============================

Then `source env.sh`

Set up your configuration
=========================

cp squeal.ini.example squeal.ini

Then edit it and set your spotify username and password.  you'll need a premium account.

Creating the base database
==========================

./create.py

Adding a music directory
========================

./addcoll.py /path/to/music/directory

Starting it up
==============

./start-squeal

Then point your browser to http://localhost:9000

The interface is "limited" at the moment, and is really just a proof of
concept.

Connecting a SqueezeBox
=======================

Tell your player the IP address of your computer as the squeezecenter.  You
will need to /etc/init.d/apparmor stop probably, since apparmor on jaunty is
irksome.

SoftSqueeze3
============

This is the software player, which is awesome for testing.

You'll need a jre::
    
    sudo aptitude install sun-java6-jre

Make sure you're using the Sun JRE too, with::

    sudo update-alternatives --config java

I had to do some messing about to get actual sound out of this, which I think
is an ubuntu/jaunty/java issue.  I had to install::

    libcsnd-java

To finally make it work - but before that I'd gone through these instructions:

http://www.ubuntugeek.com/sound-solutions-for-ubuntu-904-jaunty-users.html

Which may have been also required.  Who knows.

Installing SoftSqueeze3
-----------------------

Download the rpm version without jre here:

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=105169&package_id=113211&release_id=671140

Then convert it to a deb with::

    fakeroot alien softsqueeze_linux_3_8.rpm

This will create a deb which you can install with::

    sudo dpkg -i softsqueeze_3.8-2_i386.deb

This installs in (spit) /opt.  You can run it with::

    /opt/softsqueeze/softsqueeze

It'll spin up, and on first run will ask for your server's IP address.  Just
give it localhost.
