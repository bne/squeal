Building the dependencies
=========================

In your checkout run ./depends.sh.  This works on jaunty, I have no idea about anything else.

You'll get a few warnings.

Using the virtual environment
=============================

Then eval `./env.sh`

Creating the base database
==========================

./create.py

Adding a music directory
========================

./addcoll.py /path/to/music/directory

Starting it up
==============

./start-squeal

Then point your browser to http://localhost:9000

Connecting your player
======================

Tell your player the IP address of your computer as the squeezecenter.  You
will need to /etc/init.d/apparmor stop probably, since apparmor on jaunty is
irksome.
